				<h2>Hello World?</h2>
				<p><p>It’s my third week at the Iron Yard and I was thinking about blogging about my experience. Actually, this blog is still in its developmental phase. I planned on blogging after I was finished, but since this is also a homework assignment, might as well start posting now:</p>

<h3 id="so-heres-the-backstory">So here’s the backstory:</h3>
<p>Originally I was looking for way to create my theme from scratch. I didn’t want to use bootstrap because I’m tired of manipulating and tweaking others people’s code. (Fun fact: I actully tried the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">skeleton framework</a>, which is a good framework, but I was still annoyed.) And second, I didn’t want to invest the time to learn a CMS like Wordpress with all of its crazy components, plugins, and weird php. I wanted simplicity. So I did some research, one thing lead to another, and the next thing I know, I’m reading the docs on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/">Jekyll </a>and creating a repo through git. What your witnessing is the most simple functionality of a blog. I can add a post and I can display an archive. (Yay!) I’ll probably write a post about jekyll in the near future, but so far I’m liking it.</p>

<h3 id="life-at-the-iron-yard">Life at the Iron Yard</h3>
<p>The first two weeks have been pretty good for me. I came in with an advantage since I was a web designer at my last job and had prior programming experience, so a lot of the material has been review or brushing up on old skills. At the same time, it’s still a challenge because when your not a true beginner, you have to unlearn old habits and replace them with new ones. Everyday it feels like I’m rewiring my brain to think differently. And by 8pm, my brain finally says “Enough!” and shuts down. I try to fight it, but after staring at my laptop unproductively, my eyes start to glaze over and I throw in the towel. Sometimes you gotta walk away defeated, but you can always try again tommorow. </p>
