It has officially been one month at the Iron Yard. Kind of hard to believe that I'm a third of the way done with the program, but I'm excited. This week we covered A LOT. It was also our introduction to single page applications. One of our assigments was to create a contact form that validates the input fields. I almost cried until my instructor showed us the validator.js library which gives you pre-made functions like '.isEmail()'' or 'is.Website()'. <br/>::insert huge sigh relief:: <br/>Now I can focus on writing a script that works instead of creating my own nebulous functions.
