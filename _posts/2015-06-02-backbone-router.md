One of our homework assignments this past week was to create a game design using the Backbone router. I tried to mimic the mario game with 5 different views: a loading page, a menu page, a leaderboard page, an options page, and a game page. On the game page, I set it up so the mushroom can move left and right with the arrow keys. (Try it!) I'm still not too sure why I would use this vs the jQuery show and hide funtions, but I'm sure I'll figure it out later on in the course.
