We're finally working with APIs! I really enjoyed creating this assignment because now I'm starting to see how all the peices fit together. Bascically I had to create a wep app that allows the user to search the IMDB web app and display those results through html. There's also the added bonus of a watchlist, so the user can add and remove movies as they please.
